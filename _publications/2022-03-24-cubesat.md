title: "CubeSat measurements of thermospheric plasma: spacecraft charging effects on a plasma analyzer"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In this paper we derive ion moments (density, temperature, bulk velocity) using a CubeSat based spectrometer. The study uses in-flight data and simulation software to calculate surface potentials on the spacecraft and factors out the affects in accordance with Liouville's Theorem. We then fit the distribution functions using a Maxwellian and Kappa routine to derive the moments. Our results align with the existing Ionospheric Reference International (IRI) model and Swarm spacecraft. Issues with the on-board computer limited the scope of our invesitgation, but this is none the less the first time a CubeSat has derived plasma moments in-situ.'
