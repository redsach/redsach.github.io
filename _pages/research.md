Nowcasting Vertical Ion Drifts
------
* This project is currently on going (January 2023)
* It aims to produce a global overview of vertical plasma drifts 
* These drifts play a key role the dynamism of the ionosphere, distributing chemistry, heat and energy
* To date no such model exists

Predicting Equatorial Plasma Bubbles
------
* This project built the _APE_ model or AI Predictions of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs)
* APE is able to accurately predict the probability of an EPB which has eluded scientists for decades
* APE combines space physics, data science, machine learning, and game theory techniques
* The findings have been submitted to the _JGR: Space Physics_ journal and the manuscript is currently under review

Modelling Surface-Plasma Interactions at Europa
------
* An investigation into surface-plasma interactions at Jupiter's moon Europa
* Computer modelling of electric potentials using SPIS and multi-fluid MHD models
* Findings could inform upcoming Europa Clipper, JUICE, and lander missions
* Work was conducted in the Ocean Worlds Lab with Tom Nordheim, Camilla Harris, and Kevin Hand
* Findings will be submited to the Journal for Geophysical Research Letters
