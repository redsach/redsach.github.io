I have worked on several research projects, ranging from improving earthquake damage assessment to identifying the habitability of Jupiter's moon Europa. My areas of expertise are space plasma physics, terrestrial ionospheric physics, and data science/AI. Below is a summary of the research initiatives I have led. 

To find out more, check out my [CV](/cv) and [publications](/pubs).

Nowcasting Vertical Ion Drifts
------
* Vertical plasma drifts play a key role in the ionosphere; distributing chemistry, heat and energy
* We aim to produce a model that can accurately reproduce these drifts using AI, spacecraft data and TECU
* This project is a collaboration between UCL and the _Ionospheric and Remote Sensing_ group at NASA JPL
* A manscript will be submitted to JGR Space Physics and this is currently at the draft stage

Predicting Equatorial Plasma Bubbles
------
* Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) interfere with GPS signals which we depend on in our daily lives
* We built _APE_ or AI Predictions of EPBs which can accurately predict the probability of an EPB
* APE uses machine learning, data science and cooperative game theory to reveal new insights in EPBs
* Results are published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JA031183" target="_blank">Journal for Geophysical Research: Space Physics</a>

Modelling Surface-Plasma Interactions at Europa
------
* Europa has been identified as a potential host for life, yet much about the moon remains unknown
* We built surface-plasma interaction models to assess electric potentials and currents at the surface
* The findings will inform the upcoming <a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Europa Clipper</a> and <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/europa-lander/in-depth/" target="_blank">Lander</a> missions
* Work was conducted in the Ocean Worlds Lab with Tom Nordheim, Camilla Harris, and Kevin Hand
* Findings have been submitted to Astrophysical Research Journal Letters (ApJl)

Measuring Low Energy Ions
------
* Low-energy plasma ions are a key constituent of the Ionosphere, yet direct measurements are limited
* We developed a novel technique to measure ions using a CubeSat-based <a href="https://spaceflight101.com/spacecraft/qb50/" target="_blank">spectrometer</a> developed by UCL
* This is the first time a CubeSat has been used to successfully measure plasma moments in-situ
* Results are published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12567-022-00439-y" target="_blank">CEAS Space Journal</a>

Detecting Earthquake Damage From Space
------
* Earthquake-induced building damage can cost lives and harm economies
* We used airborne LiDAR and spaceborne radar to detect and analyse such damage
* This project was a collaboration between the University of Bath, TU Delft, and NASA JPL
