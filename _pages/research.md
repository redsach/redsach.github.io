I have worked on numerous research projects, ranging from improving earthquake damage assessment and identifying the habitability of Jupiter's moon Europa, to predicting plasma dynamics in Earth's upper atmosphere. Below is a summary of the research initiatives I have led.

# Active Projects

Modelling Magentosphere-Ionosphere Coupling
------
* The ionosphere is directly coupled to the Sun and solar wind via the magnetosphere
* This relationship changes the polar ionosphere, modifying its composition, dynamics, and behaviour
* We capture these effects with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models, ground based measurements, and satellites
* This project uses AI to ehance the capabilities of these models and observations, improving their robustness and accuracy
* Works are being carried out at the National Institute of Polar Research (国立極地研究所) in Japan

Predicting Vertical Plasma Drifts with TEC
------
* Vertical plasma drifts play a key role in the ionosphere; distributing chemistry, heat and energy
* We built the Vertical drIfts: Predicting EquatoRial dynamics or VIPER model which can accurately predict plasma dynamics
* VIPER uses TEC data as its primary input and predicts drifts captured by the C/NOFS spacecraft
* This project was a collaboration between UCL and the _Ionospheric and Remote Sensing_ group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
* The findings will be submitted to _JGR: Machine Learning and Computation_

Explainable Predictions of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles
------
* Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) interfere with GPS signals which we depend on in our daily lives
* We built _APE_ or AI Predictions of EPBs which can accurately predict the probability of an EPB
* APE uses machine learning, data science and cooperative game theory to reveal new insights in EPBs
* The findings are published in the <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JA031183" target="_blank">JGR: Space Physics</a>

Modelling Surface-Plasma Interactions at Europa
------
* Europa has been identified as a potential host for life, and will be explored by the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions in the 2030's
* We simulate the electric potentials on Europa's icy surface resulting from its interaction with its ionosphere and Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma
* We discuss the consequences of these potentials on the upcoming missions and highlight the need for additional laboratory studies
* Work was conducted in the Ocean Worlds Lab with Tom Nordheim, Camilla Harris, and Kevin Hand
* The results are published in the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ad251e" target="_blank">Astrophysical Journal: Letters</a>

Measuring Low Energy Ions
------
* Low-energy plasma ions are a key constituent of the ionosphere, yet in-situ measurements are limited at lower altitudes (< 400 km)
* We developed a novel technique to measure ions using a CubeSat-based <a href="https://spaceflight101.com/spacecraft/qb50/" target="_blank">spectrometer</a> developed by UCL
* This is the first time a CubeSat has been used to successfully measure plasma moments in-situ
* Results are published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12567-022-00439-y" target="_blank">CEAS Space Journal</a>

Detecting Earthquake Damage From Space
------
* Earthquake-induced building damage can cost lives and harm economies
* We used airborne LiDAR and space-borne radar to detect and analyse such damage
* This project was a collaboration between the University of Bath, TU Delft, and NASA JPL
