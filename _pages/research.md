Nowcasting Vertical Ion Drifts
------
* This project is currently on going (January 2023)
* It aims to produce an equatorial overview of vertical plasma drifts 
* These drifts play a key role the dynamism of the ionosphere, distributing chemistry, heat and energy
* This project is a joint collaboration between UCL and JPL

Predicting Equatorial Plasma Bubbles
------
* This project built the _APE_ or AI Predictions of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) model
* APE is able to accurately predict the probability of an EPB which has eluded scientists for decades
* APE combines space physics, data science, machine learning, and game theory techniques
* Findings have been submitted to _JGR: Space Physics_ journal and the manuscript is under review

Modelling Surface-Plasma Interactions at Europa
------
* An investigation into surface-plasma interactions at Jupiter's moon Europa
* Computer modelling of electric potentials using SPIS and multi-fluid MHD models
* Findings could inform upcoming Europa Clipper, JUICE, and lander missions
* Work was conducted in the Ocean Worlds Lab with Tom Nordheim, Camilla Harris, and Kevin Hand
* Findings will be submited to the Journal for Geophysical Research Letters

Measuring Low Energy Ions
------
* This project used a CubeSat based payload to measure plasma ions around the earth
* In-flight data analysis, spacecraft charging simulations, and data fitting techniques were used
* This is the 1st time a CubeSat has been used to determine plasma moments in-sity
* Results are published in the [CEAS Space Journal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12567-022-00439-y

Detecting Earthquake Damage From Space
------
* In this project we are doing X
  * Don't forget Z
* We are also doing Y
