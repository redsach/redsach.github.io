Nowcasting Vertical Ion Drifts
------
* This project is currently on going (January 2023)
* It aims to produce an equatorial model of vertical plasma drifts in the ionosphere
* These drifts play a key role the dynamism of the ionosphere, distributing chemistry, heat and energy
* This project is a joint collaboration between UCL and JPL

Predicting Equatorial Plasma Bubbles
------
* This research built the _APE_ or AI Predictions of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) model
* APE is able to accurately predict the probability of an EPB which has eluded scientists for decades
* We combined space physics, data science, machine learning, and game theory techniques to enable APE
* Findings have been submitted to _JGR: Space Physics_ and the manuscript is currently under review

Modelling Surface-Plasma Interactions at Europa
------
* The internship investigated surface-plasma interactions at Jupiter's moon Europa
* This involved computer modelling of electric potentials via simulations and multi-fluid MHD models
* Simulated potentials could inform upcoming [Europa Clipper](https://europa.nasa.gov/), [JUICE](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/missions/juice/), and [Lander](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/europa-lander/in-depth/) missions
* Work was conducted in the Ocean Worlds Lab with Tom Nordheim, Camilla Harris, and Kevin Hand
* Findings will be submited to the Journal for Geophysical Research Letters

Measuring Low Energy Ions
------
* This project used a CubeSat based payload to measure plasma ions at 450km above the Earth
* In-flight data analysis, spacecraft charging simulations, and data fitting techniques were used
* This is the 1st time a [CubeSat](https://spaceflight101.com/spacecraft/qb50/) has been used to succesfully determine plasma moments in-situ
* Results are published in the [CEAS Space Journal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12567-022-00439-y)

Detecting Earthquake Damage From Space
------
* Earthquake induced building damage can cost lives and cause financial turmoil
* We used airborne LiDAR and spaceborne radar to detect and analysis such damage
* The project was collaboration between the University of Bath, TU Delft and NASA JPL
