Predicting Swarm Equatorial Plasma Bubbles via Machine Learning & Shapely Values
------
Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs) can interfere with GPS signals, which we depend on in our daily lives. For a number of years scientists have tried to predict EPBs, but traditional methods have struggled. In response, we built APE or AI Prediction of EPBs to predict there occurance in space and time. APE performs well across all metrics, including skill and association. Game theory provides rich insights into the model and presents never before seen insights into EPB climatology.

[CubeSat measurements of thermospheric plasma: spacecraft charging effects on a plasma analyzer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12567-022-00439-y)
------
In this paper we derive ion moments (density, temperature, bulk velocity) using a CubeSat based spectrometer. The study uses in-flight data and simulation software to calculate surface potentials on the spacecraft and factors out the affects in accordance with Liouville's Theorem. We then fit the distribution functions using a Maxwellian and Kappa routine to derive the moments. Our results align with the existing Ionospheric Reference International (IRI) model and Swarm spacecraft. Issues with the on-board computer limited the scope of our invesitgation, but this is none the less the first time a CubeSat has derived plasma moments in-situ.
