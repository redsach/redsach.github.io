I have always enjoyed describing my work through visualisations. Below is a small selection of figures I have created, with the majority made in Python.

## Total Electron Content
Total Electron Content (or TEC) tells us how many electrons are in the atmosphere. TEC tells us how the ionosphere is responding space weather, the sun, and the atmosphere from below, and forms a key part in modelling activities.

## Plasma Bubbles
'Equatorial Plasma Bubbles' interfere the GPS signals. GPS is an essential part of our daily lives, from tracking planes to finding new restaurants. By predicting when and where bubbles might occur, we can better protect our communications and navigations systems.

## Europa and Jupiter
Europa has been identified as a potential host for life beyond Earth. To better understand its habitabiloty, we need to better understand the way in which Europa interacts with its host planet, Jupiter. We do this with simulations, but we will have many more answers (and questions!) when Europa Clipper and JUICE arrive at the moon in the 2030's.

## Shapley Values
Machine Learning is revolutionising our lives, however much remains unknown about how these models work. Shapley Values help us understand how machines reasons. This helps us improve the interpretability of these techniques, whilst also ensuring ethical usage and safety.
