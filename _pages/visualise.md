As part of my research career I have developed a number of visualisations to aid the explaination of science. Below is a small selection figures which I have designed and created with most made in Python.

## Total Electron Content
Total Electron Content (or TEC) tells us how many electrons are in the atmosphere from 0km to 36,000km (GEO). The plot above shows the TEC over a 24-hr period. Notice how peak number moves westward: this is because of the sun, which is ionising the neutral particles creation ions+ and electrons-. In the shade, things cool down and the electrons and ions recombine, reducing the TEC. Also notice the how the distribution tightens around south america. This is because our magnetic equator dips with respect to the geographic equator. TEC tells us how the ionosphere is responding to the sun, space weather, and the atmosphere from below, and forms a key part in modelling activities.

## Europa and Jupiter
Europa orbits Jupiter at 14 km/s in an anti-clockwise fashion, but is overtaken by a faster plasma torus which co-rotates at 90 km/s. Europa sits within Jupiter's strong magnetic field, and charge particles travel towards its equator via the poles. Understanding these plasma interactions is essential for the upcoming Clipper and JUICE missions, but also for any future lander missions.
