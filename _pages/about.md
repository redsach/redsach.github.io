I am a research student at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and PhD student at the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory.

I like using machine learning to advance scientific discovery. In a recent [project](/research), we used _Explainable AI_ techniques to reveal new insights into plasma bubbles, which can disrupt communications on Earth. My areas of expertise are ionospheric and space plasma physics, statistical data science, and small space. 

If you would to know more about me or my work, drop me an [email](mailto:sachin.reddy.18@ucl.ac.uk) or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/red_sach" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.
