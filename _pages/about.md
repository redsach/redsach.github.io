**I am a PhD student at the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and Research Affiliate at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I like applying data science and AI to ionospheric and space plasma physics. More specifically, I like using machine learning to beyond simply making a prediction or forecast -- but in a way that advances scientific disovery, as highlight in my most recent project [paper](/pages/research).**

**If you would to know more about me or my work drop me an email or find on Twitter.**
