I’m a scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a science team member on the Europa Clipper Magnetometer instrument. 

​I apply AI/ML across space plasmas, ocean worlds, ionospheres and magnetospheres, space weather prediction, and the search for life in the solar system.

Previously, I was postdoctoral research associate and fellow at the National Institute of Polar Research (国立極地研究所) in Japan.  I have a PhD in space physics from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and in 2023 I was awarded the UCL _Alan Johnstone Prize for Outstanding Scientific Achievement_.
