I am space scientist and JSPS postdoctoral research fellow (研究員) at the National Institute of Polar Research (国立極地研究所).  I have a PhD in space physics from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and I am a former research intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

I like using AI to advance our understanding of the solar system. In a recent [project](/research), we used _Explainable AI_ techniques to reveal new insights into plasma bubbles, which can disrupt communications between satellites and receivers on Earth. My areas of expertise are 


* Vertical plasma drifts play a key role in the ionosphere; distributing chemistry, heat and energy


My areas of expertise are ionospheric and space plasma physics at Earth and Jupiter, and machine learning. A complete overview of my background is available <a href="/files/Resume_Live.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
