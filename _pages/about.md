I am a research intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and an award-winning PhD student at the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory. In March 2024, I will commence a 2-month postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institute of Polar Research (å›½ç«‹æ¥µåœ°ç ”ç©¶æ‰€) ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ. 

I like using AI to advance scientific discovery. In a recent [project](/research), we used _Explainable AI_ techniques to reveal new insights into plasma bubbles, which can disrupt communications between satellites and receivers on Earth. My areas of expertise are ionospheric and space plasma physics, Jupiter's moon Europa, and machine learning. A complete overview of my background is available <a href="/files/Resume_Live.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
