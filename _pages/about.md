I am a computational planetary scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I am also a science affiliate of the Europa Clipper Magnetometer aboard NASA’s Europa Clipper mission. Jupiter’s moon Europa is a prime target in the search for extraterrestrial life and will be explored by Europa Clipper and ESA’s JUICE missions starting in 2031.

Previously, I was postdoctoral research associate and fellow at the National Institute of Polar Research (国立極地研究所) in Japan.  I have a PhD in space physics from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and in 2023 I was awarded the UCL _Alan Johnstone Prize for Outstanding Scientific Achievement_. 

### Expertise and interests
* Space plasmas
* Machine learning & uncertainty quantification
* Moon-magnetosphere interactions
* Ocean Worlds
* Ionospheres and MI coupling
* Space weather prediction
* Habitability of the solar system

**In general I like using AI to solve problems in space science**

If you would like to learn more, please reach out via my contact info.

My research spans planetary environments both near and far — from Earth to Jupiter’s moon Europa — with a focus on AI-driven models to better understand plasma dynamics, behaviour, and structure.

Modelling Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling
------
* Earth's ionosphere is directly coupled to the Sun and solar wind via the magnetosphere as a result of space weather
* We capture these effects with magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models, ground based measurements, and satellites
* This project uses AI to enhance the capabilities of these models and observations
* Conducted at the National Institute of Polar Research (国立極地研究所), Japan

Predicting Vertical Plasma Drift with a Neural Network
------
* Vertical plasma drift is responsible for transporting particles and energy from one region of Earth's ionosphere to another, changing its state, characteristics, and behavior
* We developed _VIPER_ (Vertical drIfts: Predicting Equatorial ionospheRic dynamics), the first model to predict this drift globally and at daily resolution  
* VIPER is a machine learning model trained on freely available total electron content (TEC) data

Explainable Predictions of Equatorial Plasma Bubbles
------
* Equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) disrupt GPS signals, affecting critical systems worldwide  
* We developed _APE_ (AI Predictions of EPBs), a model that accurately predicts the probability of an EPB detected by the Swarm satellites
* APE uses machine learning and cooperative game theory techiniques to reveal new insights into EPBs

Modelling Surface-Plasma Interactions at Europa
------
* Europa has been identified as a potential host for life and will be explored by the Europa Clipper and JUICE missions in the 2030s  
* We simulated the electric potentials on Europa's icy surface resulting from its interaction with Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma and instrinsic ionosphere  
* We discussed the implications for upcoming missions and the need for additional laboratory studies

Measuring Low Energy Ions
------
* Low-energy plasma ions are key constituents of the ionosphere, but in-situ measurements are very limited below 400 km  
* We developed a novel technique using a CubeSat-based <a href="https://spaceflight101.com/spacecraft/qb50/" target="_blank">spectrometer</a> developed by UCL  
* This was the first successful in-situ measurement of plasma moments using a CubeSat based spectrometer

Detecting Earthquake Damage From Space
------
* Earthquake-induced building damage can result in significant human and economic loss
* We used airborne LiDAR and satellite-based radar to detect and analyse structural damage post-event
