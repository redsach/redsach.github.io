I am space scientist and postdoctoral research associate at the National Institute of Polar Research (国立極地研究所) in Japan.  I have a PhD in space physics from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and I am a former research intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 2023 I was awarded the UCL _Alan Johnstone Prize for Outstanding Scientific Achievement_.

### Research Interests
* Ionospheres and MI coupling
* Space weather prediction
* Moon-magnetosphere interactions
* Machine learning & uncertainty quantification
* Plasma analyzers
* Habitability of the solar system

**TLDR**: I like using AI to solve problems in space plasma physics.
