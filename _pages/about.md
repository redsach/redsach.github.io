I am a computational planetary scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I am also a science affiliate of the Europa Clipper Magnetometer aboard NASA’s Europa Clipper mission. Jupiter’s moon Europa is a prime target in the search for extraterrestrial life and will be explored by Europa Clipper and ESA’s JUICE missions starting in 2031.

Previously, I was postdoctoral research associate and fellow at the National Institute of Polar Research (国立極地研究所) in Japan.  I have a PhD in space physics from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and in 2023 I was awarded the UCL _Alan Johnstone Prize for Outstanding Scientific Achievement_. 

### Expertise and interests
* Space plasmas
* Machine learning & uncertainty quantification
* Moon-magnetosphere interactions
* Ocean Worlds
* Ionospheres and MI coupling
* Space weather prediction
* Habitability of the solar system

**In general I like using AI to solve problems in space science**
