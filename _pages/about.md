I am a computational planetary scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Previously, I was postdoctoral research associate and fellow at the National Institute of Polar Research (国立極地研究所) in Japan.  I have a PhD in space physics from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and in 2023 I was awarded the UCL _Alan Johnstone Prize for Outstanding Scientific Achievement_. I like using AI to solve problems in space science.
