I am a PhD student at the [UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) and Research Affiliate at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). I like applying data science and AI to ionospheric and space plasma physics. 

I am working towards a PhD in Space Physics at UCL and I am a visiting scholar at the California Institute of Technology. I have published my work in a peer-reviewed journal, with 2 further 1st author papers under review. Additionally, I have presented by findings at 12+ events, including the _AGU Fall Meeting 2022_. 

I was a research intern in the _Ocean Worlds Lab_ at NASA JPL from October 2022 - December 2022. Additional I was an operations engineer for the _ion and neutral mass spectrometer_ payload on the [SOAR](https://discoverer.space/soar-satellite-for-orbital-aerodynamics-research/) spacecraft which was on orbit from June 2021 - March 2022. 

I have taught 50+ hrs of space physics, computer science, and research skills content to a range of students from high school to masters degree level. I have also supervised both BSc and MSc research projects. 

In industry, I designed and improved the manufacture of printed circuit boards in the USA and India.

I am a member of the Institue of Physics, the American Geophysical Union, and Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.
