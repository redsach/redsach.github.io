I am a PhD student at the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and Research Affiliate at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I like applying data science and AI to ionospheric and space plasma physics. More specifically, I like using machine learning to beyond simply making a prediction or forecast -- but in a way that advances scientific disovery, as highlight in my most recent project [paper](/research).

If you would to know more about me or my work, drop me an [email](mailto:sachin.reddy.18@ucl.ac.uk) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/red_sach).
