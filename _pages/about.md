Hello ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a scientist and postdoctoral research fellow at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and a science team member on the Europa Clipper Magnetometer instrument. 

â€‹I apply AI/ML across space plasmas, ocean worlds, ionospheres and magnetospheres, space weather prediction, and the search for life in the solar system.

Previously, I was postdoctoral research associate and fellow at the National Institute of Polar Research (å›½ç«‹æ¥µåœ°ç ”ç©¶æ‰€) in Japan.  I have a PhD in space physics from the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and in 2023 I was awarded the UCL _Alan Johnstone Prize for Outstanding Scientific Achievement_. 

Please drop me a line if you'd like to learn more.

  <p>We are building AI surrogates to help us characterize ocean worlds such as Europa in the search for life beyond Earth. </p>

  <p>Our ML methods are accurate and run near instanteously, allowing us to model thousands of potential scenarios for the space weather effects on Earth. A large space weather event could cost the global economy up to $1tn dollars a year.</p>

Explainable AI
------
<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/final_3.png" width="700"><br><br>
  <p>Applied game theory techniques help us understand the predictions of AI systems. We want to ask our models: "How and why did you make that decision?". By understanding how they reason we can advance science whilst ensuirng AI is ethical and safe.</p>
