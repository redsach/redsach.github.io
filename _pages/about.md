I am a PhD student at the [UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mssl) and Research Affiliate at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). I like applying data science and AI to ionospheric and space plasma physics. 

I am working towards a PhD in Space Physics at UCL and I am a visiting scholar at the California Institute of Technology. I have multiple publications, awards, and have presented by work at 12+ events, inlcuding the _AGU Fall Meeting_

I was a research intern in the _Ocean Worlds Lab_ NASA JPL from October 2022 - December 2022. I was also an operations engineer for the _ion and neutral mass spectrometer_ payload on the _SOAR_ spacecraft which was on orbit from June 2021 - January 2022. 

I have taught 50+ hrs of space physics, computer science, and research skills content to a range of students from high school to masters degree level. I have also supervised both BSc and MSc research projects. 

I worked as a design and process improvement engineer for the printed circuit board industry in the USA and India.
