I am a PhD student at the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and Research Affiliate at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 

I like applying data science and AI to answer questions in ionospheric and space plasma physics. I believe that machine learning should go beyond simply making predictions or forecasts - it should be used to advance scientific discovery and benefit society. In a recent project we used _Explainable AI_ techniques to reveal new insights into plasma bubbles which can disrupt GPS signals.
