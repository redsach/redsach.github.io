I am a PhD student at the UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory and Research Affiliate at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I like applying data science and AI to ionospheric and space plasma physics. More specifcally, I like using machine learning in a way that advances scientific discovery, instead of simply making predictions or forecasts. In my most recent project we used _Explainable AI_ techniques to reveal new insights into plasma bubbles, which can disrupt GPS signals.

If you would to know more about me or my work, drop me an [email](mailto:sachin.reddy.18@ucl.ac.uk) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/red_sach).
